# Tutorial 1

Welcome to the first in a series of tutorials about making games on Castle! In the series you will learn how to implement basic game features -- drawing things on screen, listening for input -- and also how to leverage the unique social features offered by Castle's platform -- such as making posts, storing data in Castle's database, and making multiplayer games. In this first tutorial we'll get started with the basics.
